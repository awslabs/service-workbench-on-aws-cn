Service Workbench on AWS is a cloud solution that provides secure access to data, tooling, and compute power. Using Service Workbench, researchers can perform research in a secure and configured environment. Service Workbench enables the creation of baseline research setup. It simplifies data access and provides cost transparency.

The Service Workbench installation guide covers installation of Service Workbench 5.2.0 and its related components. It provides information on Service Workbench architecture, installation, and troubleshooting. Additionally, it provides guidances for using third-party OIDC IdP providers (e.g., [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/), [Authing](https://www.authing.cn/), [Okta](https://www.okta.com/)) for identity management instead of [Amazon Cognito](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html) to enable deployment in the AWS regions without Cognito (e.g., China, HongKong)
