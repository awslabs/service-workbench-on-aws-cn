node-pandoc Changes
===================

Version 0.2.0
-------------

Breaking Changes

  * A callback is now required when calling convert(), which was previously not
    the case. It makes no sense to run the function without a callback though.

Fixed Bugs

  * Fixed an off by one error that oddly seems to only be showing up in Node
    0.6.x, but not 0.4.x.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial Release
